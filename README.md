# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Intro Project 

Welcome to the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) project! 🎉 This project aims to introduce and demonstrate the practical applications of RAG using Python code in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) is utilized here.

## Project Structure 📂

The project is organized into several folders:

- **files**: This folder contains important files for your reference:

  - `readme.md`: You're currently reading this file! It provides an overview of the project.
  - `Intro of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and application demos_Henry.pdf`: This file explains the background information and provides additional information of hands-on experiments using RAG. It's a must-read to get started!

- **python_env**: In this folder, you'll find the `NLP.yml` file. Import this YAML file to create a dedicated Python environment for running the code seamlessly.

- **code**: The `code` folder contains three Jupyter Notebook files, each representing a different experiment:

  - `1_Basic_RAG_Pipeline.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates the basic RAG pipeline. It's a great starting point for understanding the fundamentals of RAG.
  - `2_Sentence_window_retrieval.ipynb`: This notebook explores the concept of sentence window retrieval using RAG. Discover how RAG can retrieve information from a specific context window.
  - `3_Auto-merging_Retrieval.ipynb`: In this notebook, you'll learn about auto-merging retrieval and how it improves the generation process. Exciting stuff!

- **data**: The `data` folder is where you can store your own documents of interest for retrieval. For now, we have included an example file named `Henry.txt`. Feel free to replace it with your own documents to experiment with RAG.

- **common**: Inside this folder, you'll find the `openAI.env` file. Don't forget to add your OpenAI API key in this file to enable seamless interaction with the OpenAI models.

## Getting Started 🚀

To begin your RAG journey, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this project repository to your local machine.

2. Import the `NLP.yml` file in the `python_env` folder to create a dedicated Python environment. This ensures all dependencies are properly installed.

3. In the `common` folder, open the `openAI.env` file and enter your OpenAI API key. This step is crucial for accessing OpenAI models.

4. Familiarize yourself with the project by reading the `Intro of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and application demos_Henry.pdf` file in the `files` folder. It provides important background information and hands-on experiments.

5. Explore the three Jupyter Notebook files (`1_Basic_RAG_Pipeline.ipynb`, `2_Sentence_window_retrieval.ipynb`, and `3_Auto-merging_Retrieval.ipynb`) in the `code` folder. Run the notebooks to see RAG in action!

6. Experiment with RAG by modifying the provided examples or using your own documents in the `data` folder. Feel free to get creative and have fun with it! 🎊
